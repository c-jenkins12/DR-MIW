DR MIW: Dispersion Relation Magneotinductive Waveguide Design Tool

A MATLAB-based tool for the synthesis of magnetoinductive waveguide (MIW) designs based on circuit parameter estimation and analytical models for MIW dispersion.

**.MLAPP VERSION**
To setup:
1) Ensure MATLAB 2023b or later is installed on your PC along with the signal processing and symbolic math toolboxes
   Note: Older versions of MATLAB may work, but have not been verified
2) Download the .mlapp file and Images.zip from the repository
3) Unzip Images.zip to the same directory as the .mlapp file
4) Open the .mlapp file using MATLAB
5) Press run - the images directory should be automatically detected by the script

**.exe version**
1) The .exe version of the script is contained in the IntegratedDispersionToolvXXX.zip file. For further information on how to use this, along with the MATLAB Runtime Compiler see the available mathworks documentation
